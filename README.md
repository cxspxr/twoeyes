### 👁 Binocular trainer

This piece of software serves as a helpful tool to restore
a binocular vision.

#### ⚠ Caution
It is not in any way official treatment and nobody doesn't pretend it is.
It just what helps me (along with exercises) to deal with my problem,
thus I wanted to share it.

If you have strabismus or amblyopia you need to deal with them first.
Consult your doctor for that matter or at least do as many eye exercises
as you could, because it would be really hard to make use of these exercises
otherwise.

#### ↗ Motivation

There is ***really*** not so many applications that helps with that exact problem.

#### ？ Instructions

The main thing about exercises is that you need to try to either
see the both colors darkly or both colors brightly, that would be
the indicator that both eyes work.

Try to close your eyes one by one for better understanding.

#### ⤓ Installation

It is possible to install the application on desktop and
mobile. For that matter one would need a modern [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
Then when you open the website, there should be either **⊕** sign next
to the address line or the popup that suggest you to add an app to either desktop
or to the home screen of your mobile device.

In any case it is possible to install the app by clicking on
[***Customize and control Google Chrome***](https://www.live2tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/how-to-home-button-google-chrome-1.jpg)
context menu toggle and then clicking something like "Add to home screen".

#### ⛒ Offline mode

The application works fully offline once you are visited
the website, and you will receive updates once something
is updated, in case you use the officially deployed application.

### ⥅ Contributions

I am open to contributions mainly as exercises as for example:

* 2D (mini-) games written in React
* Physics simulations in React / react-three-fiber
* Interactive graphics in react-three-fiber
